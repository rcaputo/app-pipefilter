=head1 NAME

jsort - sort input files of JSON objects on key fields

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	jsort [-n] [-r] -k field_name [-k field_name] [--verbose] [file ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Write a sorted concatenation of all input JSON objects to standard
output.  Modeled after sort(1), except that key fields are specified
by JSON names rather than field positions.

The sort(1) utility is called upon to do most of the work.  The -n and
-r flags are passed directly to it.
