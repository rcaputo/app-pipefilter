=head1 NAME

jcut - cut out selected portions of each JSON object in a file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  jcut -o field_1 [-o field_2 ...] [--verbose] [file ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

jcut(1) cuts out selected portions of each JSON record and writes them
to standard output.  Multiple output fields may be specified, one per
-o flag.

=head1 SEE ALSO

You may read this utility's implementation in its entirety at

  perldoc -m jcut

L<App::PipeFilter::JsonCut> implements this utility, including the
behavior of the -o flag.

The jsonpath(1) utility performs a similar function, but output fields
are specified by JSON::Path expressions instead of simple field names.
jsonpath(1) can therefore extract data from more complex JSON objects.

L<App::PipeFilter> has top-level documentation including a table of
contents for all the libraries and utilities included in the project.

=head1 PRO TIPS

JSON is relatively verbose compared to the whitespace-separated
formats that UNIX tools usually deal with.  It's often beneficial to
jcut(1) the fields you need early in a pipeline chain and discard any
extraneous data.
