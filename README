NAME
       App::PipeFilter

DESCRIPTION
       App::PipeFilter is a distribution of shell pipeline filters designed to
       work with structured data like JSON rather than whitespace separated
       fields.

       For example, jcut is a simple version of cut(1) that understands JSON
       objects rather than whitespace separated fields.

         % head −1 sample.json
         {"network":"freenode","channel":"#perl","nick":"dngor","karma":"120"}

         % jcut −o network −o channel < eg/sample.json | sort | uniq
         {"network":"efnet","channel":"#perl"}
         {"network":"efnet","channel":"#poe"}
         {"network":"efnet","channel":"#reflex"}
         {"network":"freenode","channel":"#perl"}
         {"network":"freenode","channel":"#poe"}
         {"network":"freenode","channel":"#reflex"}
         {"network":"magnet","channel":"#perl"}
         {"network":"magnet","channel":"#poe"}
         {"network":"magnet","channel":"#reflex"}

       The jsonpath filter supports more complex expressions using
       JSON::Path’s variant of JSONPath.

         curl −s 'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=poe&o=json' |
         jsonpath −o '$..Topics.*.FirstURL' −o '$..Topics.*.Text' |
         grep −i perl |
         jmap −i col0 −o url −i col1 −o title |
         json2yaml

DESIGN GOAL
       App::PipeFilter utilities generally follow the UNIX convention of
       printing one record per line of text.  This maximizes compatibility
       with UNIX utilities like sort(1), uniq(1) and grep(1).

PRO TIPS
       JSON isn’t particularly concise, so put grep(1), jcut(1) and other
       filters that eliminate data as early as possible in pipelines.

SEE ALSO
       jcat − concatenate and print JSON files

       jcut − cut out selected portions of each JSON object in a file

       jmap − map input JSON fields to output JSON fields by renaming them

       json2yaml − convert files of JSON objects into a stream of YAML objects

       jsonpath − use JSON::Path to cut out selected portions of JSON objects

       jsort − sort input files of JSON objects on key fields

       mysql2json − convert mysql −B output to JSON object streams
